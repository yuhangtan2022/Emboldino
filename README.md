# Emboldino

## Introduction

I have a strong passion for art but always found myself getting lost or discouraged due to lack of guidance and improvement. That is why I came up with 'Emboldino' that will hopefully keep the drive in young or beginner artists to push forward and never give up. 

## Functionality

Emboldino is a social network where established artist get to showcase and display their amazing art pieces and the hours of work and dedication put into them, and receive insightful feedbacks from their viewers. Furthermore, it is a place where new artists can get inspired and gain access to tutorials, resources and more from pro artists who are willing to share their knowledge and experience on digital illustration and their journey towards greatness. Embolden is where artists can post their own artworks and resources. Embark allows users to discover new artstyles and artists to follow and learn from. The search bar can bring any artworks based on the subjects involved, the artist, many other categories to select from.
